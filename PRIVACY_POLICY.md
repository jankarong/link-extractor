# Privacy Policy — Backlink Form Filler

Effective date: 2025-09-14

## Summary
Backlink Form Filler helps users analyze a website they provide and auto‑fill link submission forms. We do not sell or share personal data. Most data stays on the user’s device.

## Data We Process
- Website content: Public page text/metadata from a URL the user enters or opens, processed to generate an AI summary and form fields.
- Product profile data the user enters: name, website, tagline, description, category, features, notes, optional logo/screenshot.
- Optional Gemini API key: entered by the user to call Google’s Gemini service.

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information. Any data is provided or initiated by the user.

## How We Use Data
- To generate AI summaries and auto‑fill form fields on the current site at the user’s request.
- We do not use data for advertising, profiling, or resale.

## Storage and Retention
- Product profiles, settings, and the optional API key are stored locally in the browser via `chrome.storage.local`.
- We do not operate developer‑controlled servers for this extension; we do not remotely store your data.
- Data remains until the user deletes it (e.g., via the extension UI or clearing browser storage).

## Sharing and Transfers
- We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties.
- When the user requests AI analysis, relevant website content may be sent to Google’s Gemini API using the user’s API key for processing. No other third parties receive data.

## Security
- The extension’s code ships with the package and does not execute remote code.
- Network requests are limited to user‑initiated fetches of public pages and calls to Google Gemini.

## User Controls
- Users can view, edit, export, or delete saved product profiles and remove the API key at any time.
- Clearing the extension’s local storage deletes locally stored data.

## Children’s Privacy
This extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Changes will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.
